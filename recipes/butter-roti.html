    <h1> Butter roti</h1>
    <h2>Ingredient needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2½ cup wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>½ cup curd</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>firstly, in a large bowl take 2½ cup wheat flour, 1 tsp sugar, 1 tsp baking powder, ¼ tsp baking soda and ½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>Pour the cup of boiling water into the flour</li>
        <li>Mix it into the flour using a fork or spoon. You will have a wet, lumpy mixture.</li>
        <li>Mixture would have cooled down a little. Knead into a soft dough. The dough will feel a little sticky but as you knead the dough will become silky smooth.</li>
        <li>If the dough doesn't feel soft you can drizzle in a little more butter and keep kneading</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick pan or thawa on the stovetop on medium heat. You may need to adjust your heat if the pan gets too hot</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 8 pieces. Roll each piece into a neat round ball</li>
        <li>Flatten the dough with the palm of your hands. Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface. You can add more flour as you are rolling to prevent the dough from sticking</li>
        <li>Roll out into a circle, about 20cm in diameter</li>
        <li>Place the roti on the pan. Cook until it starts to bubble a little</li>
        <li>Flip it over. Cook until the other side bubbles. Brush with butter and turn over again.</li>
        <li>Brush the other side with butter and turn over. You will be flipping your roti over 3 times. Takes about a minute or less to cook the roti</li>
        <li>To keep rotis soft place them in a container with paper towel at the bottom and more on top of the rotis</li>
    </ol>
