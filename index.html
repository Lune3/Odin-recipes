        <h2>Butter panner masala</h2>

        <p>
            Perhaps one of the premium north Indian or Punjabi curries if not the king of the paneer curries. 
            It is known for its mildly sweet and spicy taste with the goodness of fresh cream and butter topping with moist paneer. 
            It is one of the most curries for most vegetarians and is prepared for lunch and dinner and served with freshly baked roti, chapati, naan and even a choice of rice.
